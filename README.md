# Credit-Card-Default-Classification
project Credit Card Default Classification Prediction
# Abstract
Financial technology has become the main part of our daily lives, It 
made money transactions and payments easier. Many people make 
transactions every day, but unfortunately, some of them can’t repay 
their debts. In this paper, we aim to identify the clients who will 
become in a default state in an early stage and warn the bank about 
those clients to reduce the risk for the bank
# Summary and conclusion
• Investigated the data and checked for data 
unbalancing.
• Visualizing the features and understanding the 
relationship between different features.
• Using different models from machine learning like 
“RF, DT, Ada boost, Gradient boost, LGBM,
Xgboost, and pycaret”.
• The best model is LDA using pycaret and the worst 
one is Ada Boost using a different sample of the 
training set.
• After implementing a different model, it may use in 
the bank to determine which client deserves to get 
the credit card.
• According to the accuracy:
The best model is the Ridge Classifier model = 
82.17%.
The worst model is the random forest model using
SMOTE training set = 69%.
